     * A unidirectional many-to-many association that lets you query the groups
     * that this user is a member of. It uses the existing "group_member" table
     * as a join table. In that table:
     *
     * - The `userEmail` column refers to this user's `email` field.
     * - The `groupId` column refers to the Group entityâ€™s `id` field.
     *
     * Because the group-api-client already maps the "group_member" table as an
     * entity (to hold additional information such as role and joinedAt), this
     * ManyToMany relation is read-only and meant for convenience.
